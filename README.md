# Portfolio
In progress as I migrate code from behind CDC enteprise repositories to being hosted on my personal repos. This will take some time as much of the data are not publicly available and some of the enivronments needs to change to run on mac.

## Portfolio Contents

### Reporting

This folder contains examples of HTML reports that I developed and dissemenated while working on nationwide parasite surveillance as a member of the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria. They are meant to showcase how I consolidated and integrated diverse datasets (bionformatic, epidemiologic, laboratory) into a cohesive report that was shared with partners across 40+ jurisdictions in the United States and Canada.

The Dashboards section contains python adaptations of PowerBI and Rshiny dashboards that I created at CDC. I am working on mimicking the dashboards I previously created and thus this section is not complete

### Bioinformatic_Pipelines

This folder includes a couple of bioinformatic pipelines (primarily written in Nextflow) that I wrote to analyze next generation sequencing data. They are not able to run directly from this GitHub repo, as they are currently in the form that was used to analyze data within CDC's infrastructure. The purpose of this folder is more to demonstrate the Nextflow experience that I have.
